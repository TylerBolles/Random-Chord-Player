Random-Chord-Player generates random chords and plays them using the smoothest possible voiceleading. 
There are 3 types of random generation: a random permutation all 48 triads, a random sequence of traids of any length and a random 
chain of dominant functioning chords.  Custom chord sequences may also be entered and played. Sound generation relies on the pyo library: https://pypi.org/project/pyo/.
